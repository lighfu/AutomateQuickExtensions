- Fixed an issue where the OverlayView class could not be called.

Sorry, the OverlayView was not available, so this is the fix.

Foreground notifications have been removed from OverlayView.
To maintain the service, please enable the Service switch in the main activity.

Also, OverlayView will no longer be supported. (We are working on a substitution plan).

This is because of problems with Broadcast and the ordering method.
